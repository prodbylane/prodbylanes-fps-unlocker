A Python Based ROBLOX FPS Unlocker


What this makes this different from other FPS Unlockers is that this one's permanent, unless you reinstall Roblox


How this works is it changes code in your client, and because it does that its also detected as a false positive.

Incase it does not unlock your FPS try this!

- Reopen Roblox, the client must be reopened for changes to take effect.

- If it still doesn't work try checking if your roblox versions folder is located in C:\Users\"YOUR USER HERE"\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\

- Turn off your antivirus


I'll probably open source this soon, but for now i wont.

Also its really easy to do this manually but incase someone who doesnt know how to browse the files and stuff, this apps perfect for u
